# Image Processing Techniques
Image processing techniques refer to a set of methods and algorithms used to manipulate, analyze, and enhance digital images. These techniques allow computers to interpret and process visual information.
## Step 1: Install OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular library used for real-time computer vision tasks. Installing OpenCV allows you to perform various image processing techniques, such as reading, manipulating, and analyzing images.
## Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries
In this step, libraries required for image processing tasks are imported. These include libraries like OpenCV for image manipulation, `numpy`,  `matplotlib` for visualizing the results.
## Step 3: Load an Image
Loading an image refers to the process of reading an image file into memory, which allows you to manipulate the image further. This step is typically performed using OpenCV's `imread()` function.
# Exercise 1: Scaling and Rotation
Scaling refers to resizing an image, either by enlarging or shrinking its dimensions. Rotation involves changing the orientation of an image by rotating it around a specific point, usually its center.
# Exercise 2: Blurring and Technique
Blurring is a technique that reduces the sharpness of an image by averaging the pixel values in a neighborhood. Common blurring methods include Gaussian blur and median blur, which help in noise reduction and smoothing.
# Exercise 3: Edge Detection Using Canny
Canny edge detection is a popular algorithm used to detect the edges in an image. It uses gradient calculation and non-maximum suppression to highlight strong edges while reducing noise.
# Exercise 4: Basic Image Processor (Interactive)
An interactive image processor allows for real-time manipulation of images where users can apply different filters, transformations, or adjustments to the image and observe the effects immediately.
# Exercise 5: Comparison of Filtering Techniques
Filtering techniques are used to manipulate image data for various purposes such as smoothing, sharpening, and noise reduction. Comparing these techniques helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each method in different contexts.
# Exercise 6: Sobel Edge Detection
Sobel edge detection is a technique that computes the gradient of image intensity, highlighting areas of abrupt change in brightness, which typically correspond to edges in the image.
# Exercise 7: Prewitt Edge Detection
Prewitt edge detection is a simple edge detection algorithm that uses convolution with two 3x3 kernels to approximate the gradient in horizontal and vertical directions, identifying image edges.
# Exercise 8: Laplacian Edge Detection
Laplacian edge detection is based on the second derivative of the image. It highlights regions of rapid intensity change by finding zero-crossings of the Laplacian operator, which typically correspond to edges.
# Exercise 9: Bilateral Filter
The bilateral filter is a type of smoothing filter that preserves edges while reducing noise. It works by considering both the spatial distance and intensity difference between pixels when averaging them.
# Exercise 10: Box Filter
A box filter applies a uniform average across the image by convolving the image with a rectangular kernel. It is a simple method to blur the image uniformly.
# Exercise 11: Motion Filter
A motion filter is used to simulate the effect of motion blur, where an object appears blurred due to movement during the exposure of the image.
# Exercise 12: Unsharp Masking (Sharpening)
Unsharp masking is a technique used to sharpen images by enhancing edges. It works by subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original to amplify the differences, making edges more pronounced.
